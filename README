# Cylindrical Coordinate 3D Visualizer with Stable Camera

An interactive Streamlit application for visualizing points and cylindrical surfaces in the cylindrical coordinate system \((r, \phi, z)\).  
This tool allows real-time adjustment of the radius, angular coordinate, and height, while preserving the 3D camera angle during user interactions.

## Features

- Visualizes the cylindrical surface of fixed radius \(r\).
- Displays a point located at cylindrical coordinates \((r, \phi, z)\).
- Shows dashed projection lines connecting the point to the XY-plane and vertical height.
- Includes a fixed 3D reference frame with labeled \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) axes.
- Displays a transparent XY-plane grid for spatial reference.
- Preserves user-controlled 3D camera orientation during parameter changes.
- Supports an optional auto-rotation animation for the angular coordinate \(\phi\).
- Responsive layout that fits the plot within the browser window for all screen sizes.
